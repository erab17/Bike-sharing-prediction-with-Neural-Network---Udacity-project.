# Bike-sharing-prediction-with-Neural-Network---Udacity-project.

Simple neural network to predict daily bike sharing demand using only numpy.

Neural network configuration is done in the my_answers.py. The dataframe setup, feature modifications and prediction is done in the Jupyter notebook file "Your_first_neural_network.ipynb".
